In the past two meetups, we have been discussing EBM from a computer scientist's perspective.

In this discussion, we will discuss chapter XV of [Mehta P, Bukov M, Wang C-HH, Day AGRR, Richardson C, Fisher CK, et al. A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists. Phys Rep. 2018;810: 122. doi:10.1016/j.physrep.2019.03.001](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823)

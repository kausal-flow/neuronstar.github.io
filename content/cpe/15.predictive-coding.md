In this meetup, we will discuss this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04182

Why? Feedforward-backprop usually has a loss function that involves all the parameters. Backprop means we need this huge global loss $\mathcal L(\{w_\{ij\}\})$. However, it is hard to imaging such global loss calculations in our brain. One of the alternatives is predictive coding, which only utilizes local connection information.

In this paper ([2006.04182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04182)), the author proves the equivalence of backprop and predictive coding on arbitary graph.

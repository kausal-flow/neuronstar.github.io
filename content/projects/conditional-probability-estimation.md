## Why this Topic

Conditional probability estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in statistics.

- Conditional probability estimation is frequently used in solving both real life and academic problems. One is likely to encounter this problem at some point of their life.
- There are many models and methods to estimate the conditional probability. We can learn about and from these models and methods.
- We need a universal model to solve this problem for productivity. A universal model for this task will save us a lot of time and energy.
- Many machine learning methods are based on conditional probabilities.
  - Many classifiers
  - Bayesian networks
  - ...


## What is Our Approach

- Read and Discuss
- Apply on toy problems


### Reading List and References

We will update this list on our way forward. Here is a list of papers on [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/community/neuronstar/documents/).

We have an outline of what should be covered.

- What is the conditional probability?
  - Sampling theory
  - Bayes
  - Representation of a conditional probability
- Statistical methods to estimate the conditional probability
  - The list is enormous. We will only concentrate on the basics.
- Tree-based
  - Tree as "clustering" method
  - Application on the bike-sharing problem
- NN-based
  - NN as feature transformations
  - Application on the bike-sharing problem
- To be added as we learn more about it


### Toy Problems

We will use the following dataset.

- Bike-sharing data
  - Define a regression problem

## When and How

The discussion is online through Zoom/Skype/Wechat. It is usually held during the weekend.

- Everyone will and shall get their chance to lead the discussion.
- Interrupt and ask any questions to make sure we all understand the content well.
- Do not be carried away by the time limit. The next host will pick up the topic on the next discussion.

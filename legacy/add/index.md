Everything else will be done automatically by GitHub Actions.

## What will happen

After listing your dataset on DataHerb:

1. A page will be generated;
   <figure>
      <div>
         <img src="{{site.base_url}}/assets/videos/dataherb-ufo-page.gif" type="video/gif" />
      </div>
   </figure>

2. One could use the dataset easily. For example, one could copy & paste the python code to load the data in python. The following is an example to use the dataset in google spreadsheet.

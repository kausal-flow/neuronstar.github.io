We have discussed many topics of generative models. This paper serves as a summary of the current season of the discussions.</description></item><item><title>Self-supervised Learning: GAN</title><link>/cpe/18.self-supervised-learning-gan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cpe/18.self-supervised-learning-gan/</guid><description>We will discuss the reset of the paper arXiv:2006.08218.</description></item><item><title>Self-supervised Learning: Theories (Part 1)</title><link>/cpe/19.self-supervised-learning-theories-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cpe/19.self-supervised-learning-theories-1/</guid><description>We will discuss Section 6 of the paper arXiv:2006.08218.</description></item><item><title>Self-supervised Learning: Theories (Part 2)</title><link>/cpe/20.self-supervised-learning-theories-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cpe/20.self-supervised-learning-theories-2/</guid><description>We will dive deep into Section 6 of the paper arXiv:2006.08218. Here are a few topics to be explored.
InfoGAN objective; Positive and negative samples in loss function (InfoNCE); Uniformity in constrastive loss; JS-divergence.</description></item></channel></rss>
